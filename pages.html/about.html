			<h1>About Us</h1>

			<p>We started dog clothes collection due to our garment factory which we had a lots of unused materials, so my wife taught about the easiest way of recycling the waste into something which we can profit from it. So we decided to open our own dogs collection by designing our own products and making it available for people to use.Founded in 2018, Lapki Dog, Inc. At Lapki Dog, we love pets, and we believe pets make us better people. Every day with every connection, Lapki Dog’s passionate associates help bring pet parents closer to their pets so they can live more fulfilled lives. This vision impacts everything we do for our customers, the way we support our associates, and how we give back to our communities.

				Lapki Dog, together with non-profits Lapki Dog Charities and Lapki Dog Charities of Canada, invite more than 3,500 animal welfare organizations to bring adoptable pets into stores so they have the best chance possible of finding a forever home. Through this in-store adoption program and other signature events, Lapki Dog has facilitated more than 8 million adoptions – more than any other brick-and-mortar organization.
